# Every Single Month
This is a simple little web app to allow users to input the name of a city, and it generates a meme for them showing much money their town would receive under [Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/).

## Requirements
 - A web server running PHP with the `curl` module installed.
 - An account with [zenserp](https://zenserp.com/) if you want the Google Search results to work.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Rename `config_sample.php` to `config.php` and update the settings inside
3. Run `index.php` in a web browser.
